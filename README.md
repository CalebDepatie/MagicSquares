This project creates and displays [magic squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square) to the size specified by the user.

This was a simple project to enhance my knowledge of both Typescript and React.

I used the algorithms described in [this paper](https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/engtech/ET_Faculty/Brumgnach/Magic_Squares/Gamma_plus_two_method_for_odd_magic_squares.pdf) for determining the magic squares.

I now consider this project complete and am unlikely to touch this again, as much as the code could use a bit more love and a refactor.
